                    <p>Ok, so each "site" needs a home page.  I guess this serves as the "home page".  Every home page should also tell a bit about the purpose.  Well, that's easy!  This is a tool to create content for various brands.</p>
                    <p>Select a brand from the drop down (upper right hand corner of the screen).  Gotcha!  There's only one!  Jokes on you, homie!  Eventually there'll be more, but this is a test run.  Good luck!</p>
